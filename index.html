        <span>About</span>
        <p>Hi, I’m Luke. I turn design into growth.</p>
        <p>
          I’m a senior product designer with 8+ years of experience designing
          digital products and a strong background in software development. This
          allows me to work closely with engineers and think clearly about
          systems, constraints, and trade-offs. My focus is firmly on design,
          shaping product strategy, defining clear user experiences, and
          shipping work that has real commercial impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy working with early-stage companies, where focus and speed
          matter, and I have a keen interest in and experience building
          financial products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most recently, I worked at Spritz Finance, designing consumer-facing
          financial products in the crypto space. Previously, I’ve partnered
          with startups and established companies including Journey (YC), Peach
          Payments (think Stripe, but for Africa), Kurtosys (software used by
          the world’s largest asset managers), and MakeReign, an award-winning
          design agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I spend my time between Cape Town and the road, with
          books, long walks, and the ocean.
